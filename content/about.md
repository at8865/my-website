I am an aspiring Data Scientist, with a lot of cross-industry experience: oil & gas, steel, and software.

My background is in engineering, I have an BEng in Mechanical Engineering and a MSc in Petroleum Engineering. So you could say that I've got a pretty solid technical base to work with! I decided to take up the Data Science Specialisation on Coursera in early 2019. 

For now I am working on my predictive models. Looking for interesting projects and data sets to play around with Any completed analysis and/or models, I will link to this site.
