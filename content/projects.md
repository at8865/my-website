This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

## Practical Machine Learning Project:

The goal of this project was to predict the manner in which participants lifted barbells, from data that was taken from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. Two models were analysed: Decision Tree and Random Forest. It was shown that the Random Forest model had the highest accuracy of the two models, and by extension, the lowest out of sample error.
